## Prometheus Setup Steps
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Kubernetes cluster is set up and accessible. If you don't have a cluster, you can use tools like Docker Desktop or Minikube to create a local cluster.
- Helm is installed. You can install it using Homebrew on macOS: `brew install helm`.

### GKE Basic Prometheus Test

Follow the steps provided in the [GKE Basic Prometheus Test tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/observability-with-prometheus) to set up Prometheus on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This tutorial will give you a basic understanding of Prometheus setup.

### AWS Prometheus

If you are having trouble setup, refer to the [AWS Prometheus documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/prometheus.html) for guidance on setting up Prometheus.

### Helm Charts Prometheus

For a more comprehensive setup using Helm charts, follow the steps outlined in the [How to Set Up Prometheus on Kubernetes with Helm Charts](https://devapo.io/blog/technology/how-to-set-up-prometheus-on-kubernetes-with-helm-charts/) guide. This guide will walk you through deploying Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts.

### Custom YAML Configuration

If you prefer a more fine-tuned configuration, you can use the raw YAML configuration for Prometheus. Access the [Raw YAML File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/main/charts/prometheus/values.yaml) to get started. Modify the values as needed and apply the configuration to your cluster.

## Port Forwarding

After setting up Prometheus, you'll likely want to access its user interface for monitoring. To do this, you can use the port forwarding command:

```shell
kubectl --namespace=prometheus port-forward deploy/prometheus-server 9090
```
# Setting Up Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

This section outlines the steps required to set up Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for the open source project. GKE is a powerful platform that simplifies the management and orchestration of containerized applications.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up GKE for our open source project, ensure you have the following:

- A Google Cloud account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://cloud.google.com/).
- The Google Cloud SDK installed. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## GKE Setup

Follow these steps to set up Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for our open source project:

1. **Deploying Containerized Application:**

   The following tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a containerized application on GKE. It provides step-by-step guidance on creating a GKE cluster, deploying a sample application, and exposing it to the internet.

   [Deploying a Containerized Application on GKE Tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app)

2. **Pushing Docker Image to Artifact Registry:**

   After deploying the application, you may need to store Docker container images. This guide explains how to push Docker images to Google Cloud's Artifact Registry, enabling you to manage your application's container images effectively.

   [Pushing Docker Images to Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images)

Make sure to complete these steps to ensure a seamless setup of GKE for our project.

# General Kubernetes Setup Guide

Welcome to the Kubernautical open source project! This guide will help you set up and manage a Kubernetes environment for using Kubernautical effectively. Below are essential steps and resources to assist you in various aspects of Kubernetes management.

## Managing Kubernetes Clusters

### Deleting Clusters from Kube Config

If you need to remove clusters and contexts from your `kubectl` configuration, follow the steps provided in this Stack Overflow post:
- [Delete Clusters and Contexts from Kube Config](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37016546/kubernetes-how-do-i-delete-clusters-and-contexts-from-kubectl-config)

### Exporting Kube Config

To export a `kubeconfig` file from an existing cluster, you can use the instructions outlined in this Stack Overflow post:
- [Export Kubeconfig File from Existing Cluster](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61829214/how-to-export-kubeconfig-file-from-existing-cluster)

## Exposing Applications as Services

Kubernautical often requires exposing applications as services within your Kubernetes cluster. Learn how to do this with the following documentation:
- [Exposing Applications as Services on Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/exposing-apps)

## Load Testing with K6

For load testing your applications within the Kubernetes environment, you can use K6. Get started with running K6 by following the steps here:
- [Getting Started with Running K6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/running-k6/)

## Removing Deployments

When it's necessary to remove deployments from your Kubernetes cluster, refer to the following documentation for guidance:
- [Removing Deployments from Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/control-desk/7.6.1.x?topic=containers-stop-existing-deployments)

# Helpful Resources

```

# Kubernetes Command Instruction Guide

This guide provides essential Kubernetes command instructions to effectively manage your deployments, services, and namespaces. These commands can be directly used within your project's README.md file to facilitate collaboration and understanding among your project contributors.

## Exposing Deployments

Expose a deployment to make it accessible within and outside the cluster using different service types.

### ClusterIP

ClusterIP provides an internal IP for accessing pods within the cluster.

```shell
kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port> --type=ClusterIP
```


### NodePort

NodePort exposes pods on a specific port on each node, allowing external access via that port.
```shell
kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port> --type=NodePort
```

### LoadBalancer

LoadBalancer creates an external load balancer (if supported) to distribute traffic to the pods, enabling external access.
```shell
kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port> --type=LoadBalancer
```

Think of an IP address as your house address (unique identifier for a location).
Think of the port as the door number (specific entrance) of your house where someone knocks to enter.
Think of the targetPort as the room (inside your house) where you want your visitors to go after they've entered.

## Scaling Deployments

Scale the number of replicas for a deployment.

```shell
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<desired-replica-count>
```


## Creating Deployments

Create a deployment with a specific container image.

```shell
kubectl create deployment <deployment-name> --image=<image-name>
```


## Autoscaling Deployments

Automatically scale a deployment based on CPU utilization.

```shell
kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --cpu-percent=<target-cpu-percent> --min=<min-replicas> --max=<max-replicas>
```


## Setting Default Namespace

Set the default namespace for commands to avoid repetition.

```shell
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace>
```

## Managing Contexts

Get and manage contexts to switch between different clusters and namespaces.
```shell
kubectl config get-contexts # List available contexts
```
```shell
kubectl config use-context <context> # Switch to a specific context
```


## Describing Resources

Describe pods and deployments to get detailed information about their current status.
```shell
kubectl describe pods -n <namespace>
```
```shell
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
```

## Listing Resources

List pods, services, and deployments within a specific namespace.
```shell
kubectl get all -n <namespace>
```
```shell
kubectl get service -n <namespace>
```
```shell
kubectl get deployment -n <namespace>
```

## Exporting YAML Configuration

Retrieve and export resource configurations in YAML format for further documentation or version control.
```shell
kubectl get <resource-type> -n <namespace> <resource-name> -o yaml > <new-file-name>.yaml
```
