# Kubernautical - Prometheus Setup Guide

Welcome to the Kubernautical open source project's guide on setting up Prometheus for monitoring Kubernetes clusters. Prometheus is a powerful monitoring and alerting tool that helps you gain insights into your cluster's performance metrics. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Prometheus using various resources and links.

    - [Custom YAML Configuration](#custom-yaml-configuration)
  - [Port Forwarding](#port-forwarding)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Kubernetes cluster is set up and accessible. If you don't have a cluster, you can use tools like Docker Desktop or Minikube to create a local cluster.
- Helm is installed. You can install it using Homebrew on macOS: `brew install helm`.

## Setup Steps

### GKE Basic Prometheus Test

Follow the steps provided in the [GKE Basic Prometheus Test tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/observability-with-prometheus) to set up Prometheus on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This tutorial will give you a basic understanding of Prometheus setup.

### AWS Prometheus

If you are having trouble setup, refer to the [AWS Prometheus documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/prometheus.html) for guidance on setting up Prometheus.

### Helm Charts Prometheus

For a more comprehensive setup using Helm charts, follow the steps outlined in the [How to Set Up Prometheus on Kubernetes with Helm Charts](https://devapo.io/blog/technology/how-to-set-up-prometheus-on-kubernetes-with-helm-charts/) guide. This guide will walk you through deploying Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts.

### Custom YAML Configuration

If you prefer a more fine-tuned configuration, you can use the raw YAML configuration for Prometheus. Access the [Raw YAML File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/main/charts/prometheus/values.yaml) to get started. Modify the values as needed and apply the configuration to your cluster.

## Port Forwarding

After setting up Prometheus, you'll likely want to access its user interface for monitoring. To do this, you can use the port forwarding command:

```shell
kubectl --namespace=prometheus port-forward deploy/prometheus-server 9090
